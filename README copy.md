# strider (working title)

An unofficial [WIP] companion desktop app for playing the tabletop RPG [The One Ring 2e](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/shop/the-one-ring/) built on Electron.

The app will require the user to have purchased authentic digital copies of The One Ring materials (included for free when purchasing the physical materials from the official Free League store). 

I am not affiliated with Free League and will not be profiting from this software. The software will not be distributed and will require the user to build the app from the source code provided here.
